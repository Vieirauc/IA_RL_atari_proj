Exploring Deep Q Learning Dynamics in Atari Breakout:
A Comparative Analysis of Architectural Approaches

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to install the necessary systems, aswell as the recreation of the experiments performed by our group.

**Step 1**:
- Guarantee that python in installed on your machine,  we can verify by running the command "pip --version" on a terminal. 
- In case it is not, utilize the following link to find the version of python that is suited for your machine:https://www.python.org/downloads/

**Step 2**:
- Install Pytorch. 
- Following the link: `https://pytorch.org/` and scrolling down to the table that show the installation guide, we can see the multiple parameters that pytorch can be installed with, in our case(windows 11), the command that is generated is "pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121". We recommend that you use the same command as to avoid missmatches in code versions. 
**Step 3**:
